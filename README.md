# Basic one page angular webpage example

## To Run
```
npm install &&
npm start
```

## Requirements
Responsive design - should look good on mobile, tablet, and desktop. Note: unfortunately, the designer has left out the tablet comp. Despite this, it’s up to you to make sure the page looks and functions great on tablet devices.

Support the following browsers: Chrome (latest), Firefox (latest), mobile safari (iOS 9), chrome on android (Lollipop), and IE9+.

Embedded, responsive youtube video (your choice) - you should build this in the main block that features the “Greetings from the Satellite of Love” image

Three separate modal videos, activated when a user clicks/taps the 3 images beneath “Look what we found.” Tapping one of these should open a modal with a youtube video and an x to close.
